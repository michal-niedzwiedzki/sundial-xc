# About Sundial XC

Sundial XC is a software to facilitate time bakning and to support local communities built around the idea of time bank.
If you want to know more about the concept of "time banks" - and you really should - just look up
[prof. Edgar Cahn on YouTube](www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Edgar+Cahn+RSA).

This software is not of production quality yet. You are advised to test it thoroughly before running your time bank on it.

## Credits and history

Sundial XC is based on [Local-Exchange-UK](https://github.com/cdmweb/Local-Exchange-UK) v1.01 translated into Spanish by
[Graeme Herbert](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/graeme-herbert/9/503/794) for local time bank
[A2Manos](http://www.bancodetiempomalasana.com) in Madrid, Spain. This in turn is a fork of
[Local-Exchange](http://sourceforge.net/projects/local-exchange/).

Sundial XC was massively refactored and largely reimplemented from scratch by Micha≈Ç Rudnicki.
The URL structure, config entries, and UI flows remain the same as in original work,
but it's not guaranteed and may change in future.

## Future versions

* **Installer.** Separate from the rest of the application. Several pages to guide user through installation process.
* **Migration script from Local-Excahnge-UK.**
* **Restful API version 0.0**. API for existing model classes shielded by authorization layer. Covered in 100% with tests.
* **Android client.** Nice to have to explore correctness and completeness of API v 0.0.
* **Database normalization.** You will see the need for this one as soon as you look into existing database.
* **Interoperability between instances of Sundial XC.** Very important to connect not only members of communities, but also communities with each other.
* **Internationalization with gettext.** Yeah, currently it's in Spanish.
