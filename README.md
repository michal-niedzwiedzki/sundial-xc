# Sundial XC

Sundial XC is a software to facilitate time bakning and to support local communities built around the idea of a time bank.
If you want to know more about the concept of "time banks" - and you really should - just look up prof. Edgar Cahn on YouTube.

# Credits and history

Sundial XC is based on [Local-Exchange-UK](https://github.com/cdmweb/Local-Exchange-UK) v1.01 translated into Spanish by
[Graeme Herbert](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/graeme-herbert/9/503/794) for local time bank
[A2Manos](http://www.bancodetiempomalasana.com) in Madrid, Spain. This is in turn based on
[Local-Exchange](http://sourceforge.net/projects/local-exchange/).

Sundial XC was massively refactored and largely reimplemented from scratch by Micha≈Ç Rudnicki.
The URL structure, config entries, and UI flows remain the same as in original work,
but it's not guaranteed and may change in future.
